# Create a release
`IMPORTANT:` A release defines a deliverable artifact that has successfully passed through all 
the quality gates of the CI pipeline.

Each release receives a version (see "Creating a Release" below). Thus, it is always clear 
on a host which release is active there. The development of this repository is managed by 
means of [http://semver.org](Semantic Versioning)

The current version can be read from the `VERSION` file. The version number is not manually, 
but adjusted by script. Here you can specify which "level" of the version number should be 
recalculated: `major`, `minor` or `patch`.
